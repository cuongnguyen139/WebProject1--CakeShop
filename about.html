	        <h2>History</h2>
			<p>Although care is taken at every stage of our baking processes, sometimes a piece of eggshell, a fruit stone, fruit skin or other ingredient from the recipe can find its way into our cakes.</p>
            <p>The Tae Gateaux is an American-style bakery founded in 2004 to bring the authentic taste of American home baking to Oulu. The company opened its first branch on Hanhitie in Hoyhtyo in 2004 and has since opened a further four branches across Oulu in Linnanmaa, Peltola, Rajakyla and Toppila. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>Chau Nguyen, the company founder and Managing Director, developed the concept for The Tae Gateaux in response to what he saw as a lack of any places in Oulu to enjoy the taste of the truly authentic American-style baking. His vision for the bakery and love of American baking transpired to be something that many within Oulu, from across the Finland and globally came to share. Today the bakery sells an average of 22,000 cupcakes per week and has become a highly celebrated and iconic High Street brand.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>One of the key factors in The Tae Gateaux&rsquo;s success has been its ethos that cakes taste best when they&rsquo;ve been freshly baked using exactly the same ingredients and techniques as those used in home baking. For this reason, each and every Tae Gateaux branch has its own kitchen and a team of resident expert bakers and cake decorators. This enables the bakery to bake to order and to only offer its customers cakes that have been freshly baked the very same day.</p>
            <p>The Tae Gateaux offers a full range of American-style baked treats and desserts including cupcakes, layer cakes, brownies, pies, cheesecakes, muffins and much more. It played a lead role in bringing cupcakes and whoopie pies to popularity in the Finland and continues to innovate, introducing new and exciting cupcake flavours through its &lsquo;Daily Specials&rsquo; series. For customers looking for bespoke cakes and cupcakes for weddings, birthdays, events and other celebrations, the bakery offers its &lsquo;Cakes by Consultation&rsquo; service. This allows customers to meet with one of The Tae Gateaux&rsquo;s expert Cake Consultants in the bakery&rsquo;s purpose built consultation room and to devise their own completely unique cake creations.</p>
            <p>There is no secret to what makes The Tae Gateaux&rsquo;s cakes and other treats taste so good. Almost all of its recipes have been shared for home bakers to enjoy through its two best selling cookbooks. The first of these, &lsquo;The Tae Gateaux&rsquo;, was published in 2009 by Ryland Peters &amp; Small and to date has sold more than 650,000 copies. The bakery&rsquo;s second cookbook, &lsquo;The Tae Gateaux Days&rsquo; was published in 2011 by HarperCollins and has already sold more than 400,000 copies. The newest book, &quot;Home Sweet Home&#39;, was published in 2013 by HarperCollins and quickly reached #1 on the non-fiction bestseller list!</p>
            <p>Having opened its Islington branch in January 2012, just eight months after launching its Spitalfields branch, it is already looking for further locations within Oulu and around the Finland. The company&#39;s first franchise branch opened in the glitzy Dubai Mall in September 2012, with 2 further branches expected to open in Dubai in Summer 2013 and Winter 2013.</p>						
		    <h2>Our cakes</h2>
            <p>All of our cakes are three layers, except for the sheet cakes, which are two layers, and the New York Cheesecake, which is a single layer.</p>
            <p>Our Cupcake Cake is not a layer cake, but a giant cupcake which feeds around 12 people.</p>
            <p>As all our products are made by hand on the day, the final product will vary every time. Please bear in mind that the images on our website are for display purpose only and are not fully representative of the end product.</p>
            <h2>Storage</h2>
            <p>The following storage methods are our best suggestions, but our products are always best on day of purchase. All products should be stored in air-tight containers</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cupcakes</strong>. Do not refrigerate. Cupcakes should be fine within 24 hours of purchase.</li>
                <li><strong>Cakes</strong>. Only refrigerate if storing longer than 24 hours, except for the Cheesecake, which should always be refrigerated. All cakes should be taken out of the fridge two hours before serving for best flavour.</li>
                <li><strong>Pies</strong>. Pies topped with whipped cream or meringue should be consumed on day of purchase (they may be refrigerated, but the topping won't be as nice).</li>
                <li><strong>Brownies</strong>. Do not refrigerate. The cheesecake brownie should be consumed on day of purchase for best quality.</li>
            </ul>
